            <h2 style="font-size:28px;">Counter Strike <br><br> </h2>
			<h2 style="font-size:20px;"> We all can agree that Counter Strike is indeed a really good game but let's ignore that
			<br>
			<h2 style="font-size:21px;">fact and let's get to the point. Counter Strike is an fps game that was made in back November 8,2000. There
			are two teams in which terrorists battle to perpetrate an act of terror while counter-terrorists try to prevent it.</h2>
			<br><br><br>
			<h2 style="font-size:21px;">Counter Strike: Global Offensive is written in squirrel. Basically, it is made with a game engine called Source, the successor of GoldSrc.
			Source is entirely written in C++. Counter-Strike: Source post-release, helped to develop the game alongside Valve. Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, 
			developed by Turtle Rock Studios and released in 2004. It used the Half-Life GoldSrc engine, similar to its predecessor. <br> <br> <br>
			So what exactly are C++ functions? A function is a collection of variables, expressions and control flow statements (loops and branches).
			In fact any of the code we have learnt about in the tutorials up until now can be used in a function. The first part of a function that we write is called the signature.

		<h2 style="font-size:20px;">Minecraft is a sandbox game developed by Mojang Studios. The game was created by Markus "Notch" Persson in the Java programming language. 
		its initial release date was on November 18, 2011. <br> <br>Minecraft, players explore a blocky, procedurally generated 3D world with virtually infinite terrain and may discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build structures, earthworks, and simple machines.<br><br> Depending on their chosen game mode, players can fight hostile mobs, as well as cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. 
		Game modes include a survival mode (in which players must acquire resources to build in the world and maintain health) and a creative mode (where players have unlimited resources and access to flight).<br> <br> There is also a wide variety of user-generated content,
		such as modifications, servers, skins, texture packs, and custom maps, which add new game mechanics and possibilities.<br><br>The coding language that Minecraft uses is Java. The Java™ Programming Language is a general-purpose, concurrent, strongly typed, class-based object-oriented language. Minecraft Education Edition’s Hour of Code 2020 edition uses block-based or Python code to bring two
		villages together. </h2>

		<h2 style="font-size:28px;">Roblox <br><br> </h2>
		<h2 style="font-size:20px;">Roblox is an online game platform and game creation system developed by Roblox Corporation that allows users to program games and 
		play games created by other users. Created by David Baszucki and Erik Cassel in 2004 and released in 2006, the platform hosts user-created games of multiple genres coded in the 
		programming language Lua. <br><br> For most of Roblox's history, it was relatively small, both as a platform and as a company.
		Roblox began to grow rapidly in the second half of the 2010s, and this growth has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. You can also create your own game using the software in roblox
		called Roblox Studio. <br> <br>Roblox allows players to create their own games using its proprietary engine, Roblox Studio, which can then be played by other users. Games (called "experiences" by the corporation) are made with an object-oriented & open-source programming language based on Lua, known as Luau.
		<br> <br>	Users are able to create purchasable content through one-time purchases, known as "game passes", as well as microtransactions which can be purchased more than once, known as "developer products" or "products".
		The majority of games produced using Roblox Studio are developed by minors, and a total of 20 million games a year are produced using it.[16][9]</h2>
